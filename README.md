## Introduction

This website project demonstrates the workflow for building a simple
website for deployment on GitHub as part of **GitHub Pages**.

## Workflow

First off, the website project you are looking at has been created from
an R Project. Select *File &gt; New Project &gt; Simple R Markdown
website*.

![R Markdown website](images/rmarkdown_website.png) Build the site at
once leaving any generated files as-is during the project creation
process.

![Build Website](images/build_website.png)

This all should run smoothly. Verify that the Build Website process has
created the \_*site* folder:

![\_site folder](images/site_directory.png)

From the Terminal window, navigate to the \_*site* folder and perform a
*git init*.
